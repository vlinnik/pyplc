Description: Library for developing and debugging control logic on KRAX PLC-932 (python3)
 The pyplc module is designed for developing and debugging control 
 logic in Python 3, simplifying code writing in a style similar to
 classic programming languages such as SFC/STL/LD, but in Python. 
 It is aimed at subsequent execution on systems with MicroPython 
 (KRAX PLC-932).
